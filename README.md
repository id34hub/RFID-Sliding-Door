# RFID-Sliding-Door
RFID-Controlled Sliding Door Description: A smart automation project featuring a 3D-printed sliding door triggered by RFID technology. The system uses an ESP32 Core Board as the central controller to communicate with an RC522 RFID module. When a valid RFID card or fob is scanned, the ESP32 activates a 9g micro-servo to slide the door open &amp; closed.
